                Hi, I'm Laure D'Este, 35, living in Liège and currently working for the Customs and Excise General
                Administration of the FPS Finance (yes already). But not for long as I'll be joining the brand new team
                of functional analysts coached by Switchfully.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm pround to say that I'm quite organized, even in uncertain environments, and that I'm always eager to
                learn and discover new skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a five year's experience in the Belgian Public Services. As part of my experience at the Public
                Service of Wallonia, I arrived at the very beginning of the Belgian Kilometer Charging System. From
                Molenbeek, I was led to become the link between my management, the toll operator who won the public
                market and a brand-new team of 15 agents. Once the Molenbeek team has become more autonomous I was
                called back near my management in Namur in order to assist then on the daily management of this new
                project and I also took charge of the administrative team for the walloon road tax for vehicles.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience was very rewarding and formative. However, my responsibilities were not correlated to my
                salary scale. I then migrated to the FPS Finance 2 years ago, finally valuing my bachelor's degree (in
                management assistant FYI).
              </p>
              <p>
                For 6 months I worked at the Personnel and Organization Service before joining the Customs and Excise
                Administration where I could specialize in a more concrete business field and regain managing tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                A year and a half ago, I decided to attend evening classes to become a software developer to open up
                some new perspectives, still at the FPS Finance, in a constantly evolving field.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, the digitalization of the FPS is taking off more and more and I have the ambition to respond to
                it by making the most of my professional experience (#SoonToBeFunctionlaAlanyst) with my future diploma
                as an analyst programmer.
